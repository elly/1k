This repository is full of small, self-contained tools or libraries I've
written. The only restriction on presence in this repo is that the tool or
library must be less than 1000 lines of code.

ebf: a brainfuck compiler written in scheme
fmt.c: vsnprintf implementation
httpd.c: HTTP server with CGI and dirindex support.
inject.c: old (!) tool to inject a thread into another process
sdate.c: Outputs the date format I use.
sic0: a hack of suckless's sic irc client to be more useful
